            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Precalculus is a mathematical course that serves as a foundation for calculus.
            It is designed to help students understand the concepts and skills needed to succeed in calculus and other higher-level math courses.
            Precalculus bridges the gap between algebra, geometry, and the more advanced study of calculus by focusing on topics like functions, complex numbers, trigonometry, and analytic geometry.</p>

            <h3>Why study Pre-Calculus</h3>
            <li><strong>Foundation for Calculus: </strong>Precalculus introduces concepts that are essential for understanding calculus, including limits,
             rates of change, and derivatives.</li>
             <li><strong>Real-World Applications: </strong>Many real-world problems in physics, engineering, economics, and biology require the concepts learned in precalculus,
                 especially when dealing with growth rates, optimization, and modeling physical phenomena.</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Thinking Skills: </strong> Precalculus enhances problem-solving and analytical
                 skills that are valuable in many academic and career paths.</li>

            <p>By the end of a precalculus course, students will have a deeper understanding of functions and their behaviors, as well as the tools needed
             for further study in calculus and other advanced mathematical fields.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Definition and Types: A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of possible outputs. 
                    Common types of functions studied in precalculus include linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential, and logarithmic functions.</li>
                    <li>Domain and Range: Understanding the domain (the set of all possible input values) and the range (the set of all possible output values) of functions is crucial.
                    </li>
                    <li>Function Operations: Youâ€™ll learn how to perform operations on 
                        functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>

                    <li>Transformations: How translations,
                         reflections, stretches, and compressions affect the graph of a function.</li>
                    <li>Symmetry: Identifying even and odd functions, and understanding their properties.</li>
